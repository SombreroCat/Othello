Welcome to Othello.

How to play: 

Players can only move if they jump over an enemy player's piece.

Clicking on a piece will show all possible moves for the piece. 

The game ends when there are no more possible moves. 

The player with the most pieces by the end of the game wins.

If a player cannot make a move, but other players can, that player will forfeit thier move. 

Think wisely before moving, because you cannot undo your move.
